set Login as default screen. (component is already set in App.js)

Allow users to be able to signup via Signup link

prevent users from seeing the rest of the site until they are verified.

on the Homepage component, users can upload video to the database and have
    ability to see thumbnails of past videos uploaded. The videos can be loaded
    with a button, but would love to be able to use drag and drop.

Targeting (or tags) of these videos: Age/State/Gender and ability to delete
      videos

Make sure React Router 4 is running correctly (believe it already is, may need
      to add more Routes)

Most of the info for the database is in the other repo ("Backend"), but was
      initially written in Angular using the create-react-app package. I'm
      not familiar with Angular, but assume you can dig through and find the
      stuff you need.
